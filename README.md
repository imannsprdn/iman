I like everything about these Fiesta dishes. The Cobalt blue is a beautiful color. They have a nice weight to them. I have not used them yet but I hope that they live up to the claim of being able to not only go in dish washer and microwave, but the true test will be rather or not they can be used in the oven. Time and usage will tell. I would recommend this Fiesta product.
